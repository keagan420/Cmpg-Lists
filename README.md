# Cmpg-Lists Production
This is repository for lists including linked lists , stacks and queues

## Description 
A linked list is an alternative to an array.
The most important characteristic of a linked list differentiating it from arrays is the fact that the data elements are NOT stored in adjacent memory positions as is the case with arrays.
With arrays we know that each item is stored next to the previous one in memory – with linked lists EACH ITEM NEEDS TO CONTAIN INFORMATION on the memory position of the next item!
The programmer needs to know where the first NODE is.
Each NODE consists of the 1. data element and 2. the address of the following node
